# 🚀 **Introducing CF Buddy: Your Ultimate Codeforces Companion!** 🚀  

Competitive programming isn’t just about solving problems—it’s about tracking progress, analyzing performance, and learning from every contest. That’s why I built **CF Buddy**, a Codeforces utility app that helps you stay ahead in the game!  

## 🔍 What can CF Buddy do?  

### ✨ **Profile Section**  
- 🔹 Track your rating, recent contest performance, and activity info  
- 🔹 Analyze your momentum meter to see your progress trend  

### 📅 **Contests**  
- 🔹 View the upcoming contest calendar so you never miss a challenge  
- 🔹 Analyze your finished contest performance  
- 🔹 Compare your ranking with friends using the friend ranklist  

### 👥 **Friends**  
- 🔹 Peek into friends' profiles, submissions, and stats  

### 📊 **Submissions & Stats**  
- 🔹 Monitor your submissions efficiently  
- 🔹 Dive deep into contest-wise, submission-wise, problem rating-wise, and problem tag-wise analytics  

## 💡 **Tech Stack**  
- 🔹 **Frontend**: Flutter, Provider  
- 🔹 **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB  
- 🔹 **API**: Codeforces API  

## 🚧 **Challenges & Future Improvements**  
One of the biggest challenges was fetching all friends' handles together, as Codeforces doesn’t provide a bulk API.  
Currently, profiles load individually, but I’m actively working on optimizing this!
